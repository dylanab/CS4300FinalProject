What are you working on?

Chris: Wireframes, wireframes , wireframes. Going to be adding in some AngularJS functionality after I do some initial CSS styles.

Michael: Added the schema; see commit comment

Luke: So until 5 minutes ago I was under the impression that the servlet made helper objects and setAttributes for the jsps. Chris showed me you can just call helper functions from jsp(except for post requests). Which makes SO MUCH SENSE. So now I'm going to throw out a lot of servlet code and redo it the simple way. AND add usebeans and jsp:setproperties to the jsps
MasterServlet: done except for editingView post request.
jsps: working on it
